- Dispatched actions from components and accessed global state using `useSelector`.

📁 **Folder Structure**
- `store.js` — to configure the Redux store.
- `userActions.js` — to define user-related Redux actions.

✅ **Outcome**
The Redux store now holds the user's email and can be accessed anywhere in the app. It's super handy for features like login status, profile pages, and dashboards.

---

### 🔁 Milestone 32: Going Global with Redux (Part 2)

Building on the previous Redux work, I took it a step further and expanded how I used global state throughout the app.

🌐 **What I Did**
- Stored user email from the login page.
- Retrieved that email from any other component.
- Used `dispatch` to update state and `useSelector` to access it.

🎯 **What This Enabled**
- Avoided repetitive prop passing.
- Created a more connected and scalable app.
- Laid the groundwork for user-specific content.

🚀 **Result**
Managing global state became intuitive and powerful — now I can build faster and smarter!
