Ecommerce-Follow-Along

#### *Description and Summary*

Welcome to the *Ecommerce-Follow-Along* project! It's an exciting, mentor-guided journey in which we build a complete e-commerce platform with the MERN stack. Through this process, we will engage in creating scalable APIs, securing authentication, creating database schemas, and setting up the backend in Node.js using Express.

---
##  *Milestone 1: Project Overview*
### Why the MERN Stack?   The MERN stack is one of the most popularly used full stacks in web development for the following reasons:
- It is built using *JavaScript* throughout (frontend + backend), making it beginner-friendly.  
- Every component is powerful yet lightweight, letting us build modern, scalable web applications.
 
Here's what MERN contains:  
- *MongoDB*: A NoSQL database to store our application data.  
- *Express*: A framework for building the backend logic.  
- *React*: A library for building our user interface.
- *Node.js*: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.  

---

### *What This Project Builds*  

#### *REST API Structure and Endpoints*  
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) let the frontend and backend communicate. We‚Äôll build a REST API that supports:  
1. *User Authentication*: Allowing users to register and log in securely.  
2. *Product Management*: Adding, updating, and retrieving product details.
3. Order Handling:  Seamless handling of customer orders.

The APIs would connect to our MongoDB database and get data back out, returning data formatted in JSON-JSON makes them more accessible and thus easier to be tested.

#### Database Schema Design
The databases are an absolute necessity to having everything go properly. For this MongoDB project:  
- Define all your collections: examples include products, users, or orders.
 Structure relationships that have to do with features like: user orders as well as products categories.

#### *Role of Authentication*  
Authentication is all about verifying who the user is. It‚Äôs what keeps an e-commerce site safe and ensures users can make purchases, view orders, or access personal data securely. We‚Äôll implement secure login and registration features that protect sensitive information.

---

### *What I Learned*  
This project will help you:
- Design scalable APIs for real-world applications.
- Build a strong backend using Node.js and Express.
- Design structured databases with MongoDB. 
- Implement secure authentication mechanisms. 
- Use React to build a modern, user-friendly interface.

### *Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page* 

Day 2: Login Page Implementation
What I Did Today
On Day 2 of the follow-along project, I worked on implementing a LoginPage component using React. Below are the details of what was accomplished:

Key Features
State Management:

Utilized the useState hook to manage user credentials (email and password).
Dynamic Input Handling:

Added a handleChange function to dynamically update the state as the user types in the form fields.
Form Submission:

Created a handleClickLogin function to handle form submission. (Currently, API integration is commented out for future implementation.)
Responsive Design:

Designed the login page using Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive layout.

const [credentials, setCreds] = useState({
  email: "",
  password: ""
});

const handleChange = (event) => {
  const { name, value } = event.target;
  setCreds({
    ...credentials,
    [name]: value
  });
};

const handleClickLogin = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Submitted Credentials:", credentials);
};


User Interface
The login page includes:
Email Input Field: For users to enter their email address.
Password Input Field: For users to enter their password.
Submit Button: To initiate the login process.
Challenges Faced
Tailwind CSS Setup:

Ensured the Tailwind setup was correctly configured in tailwind.config.js.
Imported required Tailwind directives in the project‚Äôs main CSS file.
Backend API Integration:

While initially planning to use Axios, API integration is postponed, and the Axios import is commented out for now.
Next Steps
Integrate backend API for user authentication.
Implement proper error handling and form validation.
Enhance UI/UX by displaying success or error messages after login attempts.

### Milestone 3 Overview
In this milestone, I have successfully implemented the following key features for the backend project:

Backend Folder Structure
I have meticulously organized the backend project files by creating a well-defined hierarchy. This includes separating essential components such as routes, controllers, models, and middleware. This structure not only ensures a clean and manageable codebase but also lays the foundation for scaling the application as new features are added. Additionally, I have started understanding terms like utils and middlewares, which play an integral role in backend development.

Node.js Server Setup
To handle API requests efficiently, I set up a Node.js server using Express. The server has been configured to listen on a designated port, ensuring smooth communication between the client and server. This setup serves as the backbone for managing backend processes and acts as a gateway for future API integrations.

MongoDB Integration
I successfully integrated MongoDB into the project, enabling efficient and reliable data storage. The integration process included setting up a connection between the server and the database, which has been thoroughly tested and confirmed. This step ensures that the application can handle data management seamlessly, paving the way for robust CRUD operations.

Error Handling Implementation
Recognizing the importance of a resilient application, I implemented basic error-handling mechanisms. These include providing clear error messages that enhance the debugging process and offer better user feedback. The error handling setup not only improves the reliability of the application but also makes it more developer-friendly for future troubleshooting and enhancements.

Additional Notes
Throughout this milestone, I have followed best practices to ensure that the backend code remains modular and maintainable. By adhering to a structured approach, I have set a solid groundwork that will support the development of more advanced features in subsequent milestones. This milestone also served as an opportunity to enhance my understanding of backend architecture and the integration of modern tools like MongoDB.

With these achievements, the foundation for a robust and scalable backend system is firmly in place. Moving forward, I am well-prepared to tackle more complex functionalities, optimize the existing codebase, and ensure the backend system aligns seamlessly with the project‚Äôs overall goals.

# Milestone 4: Livebooks Backend Web Development

by the end of this milestone:

- *Create a User Model*: Think of it as the blueprint for storing user data like name, email, and password in the database.
- *Create a User Controller*: This will help you manage user-related actions like adding new users and fetching their details.
- *Enable and Configure Multer*: Want users to upload profile pictures? Multer‚Äôs got your back!
- *Update the README File*: Don‚Äôt forget to document your progress here.

---

## What‚Äôs the Plan?

### 1. What‚Äôs a Model?
A model is like a blueprint. It defines how data is structured in your database. Imagine designing a house‚Äîyou need a plan first, right?

In MongoDB, we use schemas to define models. For example:

javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);


### 2. What‚Äôs a Controller?
Think of a controller as the manager of your app. It decides how to handle incoming requests and what responses to send back.

For example, here‚Äôs a simple controller to create a new user:

javascript
const createUser = (req, res) => {
  const { name, email, password } = req.body;
  const newUser = new User({ name, email, password });

  newUser.save()
    .then(() => res.status(201).send('User created successfully!'))
    .catch(err => res.status(500).send(err));
};

module.exports = { createUser };


### 3. File Uploads with Multer
Multer is a game-changer for handling file uploads. It lets users upload files, like profile pictures, to your server.

Here‚Äôs how you set it up:

javascript
const multer = require('multer');

const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, 'uploads/');
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, `${Date.now()}-${file.originalname}`);
  }
});

const upload = multer({ storage });
module.exports = upload;


---

## Steps to Rock Milestone 4 üìù

Here‚Äôs the plan:

1. *User Model*: Build and implement the user schema with Mongoose.
2. *User Controller*: Write functions to handle user operations (like creating and retrieving users).
3. *Multer Magic*: Enable file uploads and set up storage for user files.
4. *Document It*: Update this README to reflect your progress.

## Milestone 6: Backend Web Development [V2] - Deploying Your API (Local and Production)

### Overview
This milestone focuses on creating a secure backend endpoint for the Signup page. The primary goals were to securely store user data, including encrypting passwords, and to ensure compliance with modern security standards.

### Learning Goals üéØ
By the end of this milestone, I achieved the following:
- *Password Encryption:* Learned how to encrypt passwords using bcrypt before saving them.
- *Secure Data Storage:* Successfully stored user data securely in the database.
- *Understanding Security Best Practices:*
  - Protecting user data from unauthorized access.
  - Ensuring compliance with regulations like GDPR and PCI-DSS.

## *Milestone 7!* üåü  

Today, we‚Äôre diving into one of the most important parts of any backend system: user login. The goal here is to validate user credentials and securely verify passwords stored in your database. Let‚Äôs make it happen! üöÄ  

---

## What I Learned? üéØ

By the end of this milestone, you‚Äôll:  
- Understand how to validate user credentials during login.  
- Learn how to compare encrypted passwords with user inputs securely.

---

## Why Do We Encrypt Passwords? üõ°

Here‚Äôs why password encryption is such a big deal:  
1. *Protect User Data:* Even if the database is compromised, passwords remain safe.  
2. *Privacy:* Passwords won‚Äôt be stored in plain text (a major security no-no).  
3. *Compliance:* Meets standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS.  
4. *Prevents Password Theft:* Hashed passwords are tough to crack, which keeps things secure.

---

## How Does Login Authentication Work? üîë

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the login process:

1. *User Enters Their Credentials:*  
   - On the login page, users type their email/username and password.

2. *Fetch User Data from the Database:*  
   - The backend checks for the user in the database using the provided email/username.  
   - If no user is found, the system responds: "User does not exist."

3. *Compare Encrypted Passwords:*  
   - The system processes the entered password using the same hashing algorithm (like bcrypt).  
   - The hashed password is then compared with the one stored in the database.  
   - If the hashes match, login succeeds. If not, the user gets an error.  

*Fun fact:* Passwords are not "decrypted" because hashing is a one-way process. Instead, hashes are matched!

---

## Steps for Milestone 7 üìù

1. *Build the Login Endpoint:*  
   - Accept user credentials (email/username and password).  
   - Retrieve the user‚Äôs data from the database.  

2. *Validate the Password:*  
   - Use bcrypt (or a similar library) to hash the input password.  
   - Compare the hashed password to the stored one.  
   - Authenticate the user if they match.
